# How to play

The game is turn-based, meaning that the player takes one action, then the enemies take one action, etc. This means that thinking about your next move can have a great impact on winning or losing.

## Controls

- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the character.
- Use G to pick up an item when you are on the same tile.
- Use the number keys to use the associated item listed on the top left of the screen.
- Use Enter to close a message box, click on a button on the title screen, or return to the title screen after the end of the game.

## Tips
