# The Amulet of Sirref: A Rust Roguelike

This small turn-based game written in Rust allows you to explore procedurally-generated levels in the search for the _Amulet of Sirref_, an artifact that will rid the world of monsters. You will however have to fight said monsters to find it. Collect items on your way to help you: a sword, some armor, perhaps a map, and some health potions.

The basic concept of the game is based on Herbert Wolverson's [Hands-on Rust](https://hands-on-rust.com/) book, but many game mechanics were changed and/or added.

# Playing the Game

Thanks to Rust's support for web assembly, you can play the game directly on your browser! [Try it out!](https://thibautbaguette.com/rust-roguelike/) (Disclaimer: the game can technically run on mobile devices, but requires a keyboard as an input device)

For a guide on how to play the game, see [this page](./how_to_play.md).

## Playing Locally

You can also run the game locally by cloning the repository and running `cargo run` in the main directory (given that the Rust toolchain is installed).
